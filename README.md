jbake-example-project-groovy-mte-bootstrap
==========================================

Example project structure for JBake that uses Groovy MTE templates and Bootstrap.

This is mostly a customization of jbake-example-project-groovy to use
MTE tpl files in place of gsp files.

Additionally, it includes a cleanup for grouping posts by date on
archive and tags pages.
